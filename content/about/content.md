The small town of Crescent City Illinois blew up on June 21, 1970.
The town was heavily damaged but amazingly no one was killed. That alone should be celebrated.

The Fireball Festival is not so much the celebration of a disaster, but a celebration of a community’s ability to persevere, to experience devastation and come out the other side.

The weekend of June 19th – June 21st will be the 50-year anniversary of that event.

We invite you to celebrate with us.
