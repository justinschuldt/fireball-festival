The small town of Crescent City Illinois blew up on June 21, 1970.
The town was heavily damaged but amazingly no one was killed. That alone should be celebrated.

The Fireball Festival is not so much the celebration of a disaster, but a celebration of a community’s ability to persevere, to experience devastation and come out the other side.

The weekend of June 12th – June 15th, 2025 we will celebrate the 55-year anniversary of that event. The festival kicks off with a 5K on Thursday, June 12.  Many other events to follow the rest of the weekend.

We invite you to celebrate with us.
