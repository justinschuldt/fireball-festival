On June 21st 1970, though the town of Crescent City was heavily damaged, no one perished. Every five years we gather to celebrate.

The Fireball Festival is not a the celebration of the disaster, but a celebration of a community’s ability to persevere.

The weekend of June 18th – June 20th 2021 will be the 51st anniversary.

We invite you to celebrate with us.
